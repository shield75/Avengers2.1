                    <b>Iron Man</b> is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. His
                    real name is
                    Tony Stark.
                    He has built many <b><i><u>Super Robots</u></i></b> and has AI built assistant named
                    <b>JARVIS.</b>.Genius
                    inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after his parents’
                    untimely deaths and
                    flew it to even greater heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile for
                    the U.S.
                    military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and he was
                    severely
                    wounded. Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near
                    his heart
                    had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had
                    inserted a
                    powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it temporarily.At the very core of the Iron
                    Man technology lies the Arc Reactor. Designed by Howard Stark, but augmented and strengthened by
                    Tony Stark, the Reactor provides a clean, manageable energy source with incredible output, one that
                    can be adapted to most anything. At first a large piece of equipment, the younger Stark miniaturized
                    the technology into the “RT,” which was the size of a human heart, and put it to great use to power
                    his suits of armor.
